## DA Project - Potential markets analysis 

This repository documents the analysis of the distribution of the different internet services to identify market oportunities. The project is organized into the following key stages:

[01_EDA](01_EDA.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis.

[02_Dashboard](02_Dashboard.ipynb): 


#### [01_EDA:](01_EDA.ipynb) Exploratory data analysis.

This stage involves the data initial exploration and transformation of the three main datasets:
steam_games, australian_users_reviews, and australian_users_items, for subsequent analysis and the development of recommendation systems.

#### [02_EDA:](02_EDA.ipynb) Exploratory data analysis.

I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain deeper insights into the transformed data. I reduce the analysis process to the few variables I decide to use in the recommendation system model. EDA helps me identify patterns, outliers, and potential relationships that will inform the recommendation system's design and customization.
